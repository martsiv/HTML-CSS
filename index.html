    <h2>
        Linear Equations
    </h2>
    <p>
        A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
    </p>
    <p class="align-center">
        <samp>
            ax + b = 0
        </samp>
    </p>
    <p>
        where <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are real numbers and <var>x</var> is a variable. This form is sometimes
        called the standard form of a linear
        equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be
        an x so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <var>x</var> there.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Quadratic Equation
    </h2>
    <p>
        The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
    </p>
    <p class="align-center">
        <samp>
            ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0
        </samp>
    </p>
    <p>
        where <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var> are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know
        it yet). Also, <var>a</var> can't be 0.
    </p>
    <h2>
        The area of a circle (A)
    </h2>
    <p>
        <var>&#960</var> (Pi) times the radius (<var>r</var>) squared:
    </p>
    <p class="align-center">
        <samp>
            A = &#960 &#215 r<sup>2</sup>
        </samp>
    </p>
    <p>
        or, when you know the diameter (<var>D</var>):
    </p>
    <p class="align-center">
        <samp>
            A = (&#960 / 4) &#215 D<sup>2</sup>
        </samp>
    </p>
    <p>
        or, when you know the circumference (<var>C</var>):
    </p>
    <p class="align-center">
        <samp>
            A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &#215 &#960
        </samp>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Intersection
    </h2>
    <p>
        The intersection of two sets <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>, denoted by A &#8745 B, is the set of all objects
        that are members of both
        the sets A and B. In symbols,
    </p>
    <p class="align-center">
        <samp>
            A &#8745 B = { x : x &#8712 A and x &#8712 B }
        </samp>
    </p>
    <p>
        That is, <var>x</var> is an element of the intersection A &#8745 B if and only if <var>x</var> is both an
        element of <var>A</var> and an element
        of <var>B</var>.
    </p>
