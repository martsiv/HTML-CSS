                <p>
                    William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor,
                    widely
                    regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is
                    often
                    called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations,
                    consist
                    of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of
                    uncertain
                    authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more
                    often
                    than those of any other playwright.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married
                    Anne
                    Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between
                    1585
                    and
                    1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing
                    company
                    called
                    the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to
                    have
                    retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life
                    survive;
                    this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his
                    sexuality,
                    his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories
                    are
                    often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the
                    period.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily
                    comedies
                    and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until about 1608,
                    he
                    wrote
                    mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the
                    finest
                    works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as
                    romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his
                    lifetime.
                    However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell,
                    published
                    a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's
                    dramatic
                    works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in
                    which
                    Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all time".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and
                    rediscovered
                    by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are studied,
                    performed,
                    and
                    reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts around the world.
